# 🃏 MERN Blackjack Tracker

A simple full-stack Blackjack game tracker built using the MERN stack. This app allows users to create, view, and delete game sessions, tracking the player and the outcome (won/lost/playing). It's meant as a technical checkpoint to verify full-stack integration.

- **Express + Node.js** – RESTful API backend
- **React** – Frontend client
